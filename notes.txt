The REPL will be shell-like if possible, with a VERB NOUN NOUN... syntax.

compile("file", "file", ...)
[[["action"]] = "compile"]
add file_a
add file_b
add file_c
compile
add file_b
compile
analyze file_b

Every statement/expression returns exactly one value. The form may return Nothing. It may return Values(form1, form2, ...)
All functions are global.
